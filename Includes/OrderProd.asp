    ordering software online as easy and as rewarding as possible.</font>
   <br><br><br><br><a name="paymentmethod"><b><font class="highlightfont"><center>Payment Methods</center></font></b></a><p>
    <font class="textfont">We currently accept four different methods of 
    payment:</font><p><font class="textfont"><b>Credit Card - </b>Online 
    transaction through our secured Payment gateway.&nbsp; This is the fastest 
    method for receiving your goods and your payment is confirmed within seconds 
    online.&nbsp; We currently are accepting <b>Visa, Mastercard</b> and <b>
    Bankcard</b>.</font><p><font class="textfont"><b>Direct Deposit - </b>
    During the checkout process you have the option of selecting this method of 
    payment.&nbsp; When you choose to pay by Direct Deposit, a screen will come 
    up with our Bank Details for you to make the deposit and further 
    instructions on how to speed up your order.&nbsp; Please remember to email 
    our <b><a class="textfontlinks" href="mailto:orders@deliverance.com.au">orders@deliverance.com.au</a></b> 
    account with the details of the deposit for the quickest response.&nbsp; 
    Once we have confirmed your deposit we will begin processing your order.</font><p>
    <font class="textfont"><b>Cheque - </b>Payment by cheque is another 
    option in the checkout process.&nbsp; When you opt to pay by cheque you are 
    given details on whom to make the cheque out to and the payment amount.&nbsp; 
    Once the cheque clears we will begin processing your order.&nbsp; Bear in 
    mind that cheques normally take 3 - 5 working days to clear.</font><p>
    <font class="textfont"><b>Money Order - </b>Payment by Money Order is 
    similar to cheque except that banks treat a Money Order similar to cash so 
    there is clearance time required.&nbsp; Once we have deposited your Money 
    Order we will begin processing your order.</font><p>&nbsp;<p><a name="preorder"><b>
    <font class="highlightfont"><center>Pre-Ordering</center></font></b></a><p><font class="textfont">One 
    of the best ways to ensure you receive a copy of the best new games as soon 
    as they are released is to pre-order.&nbsp; We do not charge your credit 
    card for any pre-orders until we begin making preparations to receive and 
    ship the games (this is usually within 1 - 2 weeks of the release date).&nbsp; 
    However, once you place your pre-order with us you have confirmed your order 
    and any unforseen changes in price that sometimes arrive will not impact you 
    as we will charge you the confirmed price.&nbsp; If however the price drops, 
    you will receive that savings.</font><p>&nbsp;<p><a name="returns"><b><font class="highlightfont">
    <center>Returns Policy</center></font></b></a><p><font class="textfont">We want all of our 
    customers to be fully satisfied with all of their purchases and endeavour to 
    provide you with as much information about the games you can buy as 
    possible.&nbsp; However, once you purchase a game we can accept no returns, 
    exchanges or refunds because you have chosen the wrong item or are not happy 
    with your purchase.&nbsp; Our suppliers guarantee that the title is in 
    working condition when it is shipped to you, in the unlikely event of a 
    failure we will do a direct exchange of the product provided we are notified 
    within 14 days of purchase and you have all the original packaging.</font><p>&nbsp;<p><a name="prodinfo">
    <b><font class="highlightfont"><center>Product Information Help</center></font></b></a><p>
    <font class="textfont">In an effort to ensure that you are happy with 
    every purchase, we have setup a special email address
    <b><a class="textfontlinks" href="mailto:help@deliverance.com.au">help@deliverance.com.au</a></b> that 
    you can use to send questions to about any item that we sell.&nbsp; We may 
    not have all of the answers, but we can help ensure that you buy the right 
    product for the right platform and other issues like that.&nbsp; It would 
    not be reasonable for us to answer questions regarding the quality of games 
    as that is a personal preference, but we can offer suggestions on similar 
    games to ones you like or things like that.&nbsp; Try this out and see how 
    you like it; nothing ventured, nothing gained.</font></td>
